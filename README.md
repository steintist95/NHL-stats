# NHL-stats - Written on Windows using Python 2.7.12
This is a script designed to go to each NHL team's respective website and find/extract the team stats for the season
After finding the data, the stats are put into each team's respective MySQL database, as well as a separate database for all of the goalies - Logging included
Stay tuned for updates
Possible Updates:
  1. Using Pyquery (pip install pyquery) to aid in the selection of tables
Scheduled Updates:
  1. Code Cleanup/Shrink
  2. Send a notification each time the script runs
  3. Auto run script daily (Using Windows Task Scheduler and Batch Script)
  4. Account for players who do not currently have a number - as of now, their stats must be manually entered
